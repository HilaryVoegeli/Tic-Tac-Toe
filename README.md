# Tic Tac Toe
## Here is a tic-tac-toe game created with React! 
### To Run: Clone the repository; In command prompt, find the project location; Run npm install http-server; Run http-server -c-1; Open your browser and navigate to the localhost. Or navigate to the GitHub Page: https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/ 

#### Roadmap of Future Improvements: A button that will refresh the game board without refreshing the entire webpage.
